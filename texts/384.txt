Caption: 
FRAP of GFP-E-APC and GFP-tagged AJ proteins in early embryonic epithelial cells. Face-on views of live ~6 hours old embryos (stage 11) expressing (a) GFP-E-APC, (b) E-cadherin-GFP, (c) Armadillo-GFP, (d) Î±-catenin-GFP, with white squares marking sections of cell interfaces that were bleached, and red squares marking unbleached control sections. Pre-bleaching images are shown on the left; subsequent images on the right show recovery of fluorescence within white squares 15, 75 and 300 seconds after bleaching [see additional file 1].
Question:  How long after bleaching were the images taken to show recovery of fluorescence? 
 
A: 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds 
B: 15 seconds, 75 seconds, 300 seconds 
C: 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes 
D: 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours 
Answer:  B: 15 seconds, 75 seconds, 300 seconds
