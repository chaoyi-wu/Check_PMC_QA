Caption: 
Isolated overexpression of Xmab21l2 produces partially dorsalized embryos. A, C, E: control-injected embryos; B, D, F: Xmab21l2-injected embryos. Aâ€“D: tailbud-tadpole stages; E, F: gastrula stage. In B: external appearance of Xmab21l2-injected embryos. D: horizontal section of an Xmab21l2-injected section stained with orange-G/aniline blue. Note enlarged notocord (nc). F: expanded and enhanced Chordin expression in Xmab21l2-injected gastrulae (blue signal).
Question:  Which stages were observed in both control and Xmab21l2-injected embryos? 
 
A: Tailbud-tadpole stages. 
B: Gastrula stage. 
C: Blastula stage. 
D: Fertilization stage. 
Answer:  A: Tailbud-tadpole stages.
