Caption: 
Angiotensin II receptor 1 staining in lung biopsies from control patients (A) and from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (B). Immunohistochemistry for the angiotensin II receptor 1 (AGTR1), counterstained with haematoxylin. AGTR1 positive staining is seen in alveolar macrophages, in epithelial cells and in fibroblastic foci (arrows) in usual interstitial pneumonia biopsies (panel B). Epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages express AGTR1 in control lung biopsies (panel A).
Question:  What is the function of AGTR1? 
 
A: To decrease inflammation in the lungs 
B: To promote lung cancer 
C: To cause pulmonary fibrosis 
D: To bind with angiotensin II. 
Answer:  D: To bind with angiotensin II.
