Caption: 
WT Aggregates Are More Likely to Have TUNEL-Positive Cells Than ΔRD1 AggregatesRepresentative fluorescent images of aggregates following TUNEL staining of 6-d postfertilization embryos infected with 71 green-fluorescent WT (A), or 474 green-fluorescent ΔRD1 (B) bacteria. TUNEL staining is imaged with red fluorescence, and colocalization with green-fluorescent bacteria appears yellow. Scale bar, 100 μm.
Question: What is the purpose of the TUNEL staining in the study described in the passage? 
 
A: To visualize the location of bacterial infection in embryo cells 
B: To identify the presence of a specific cell type in infected embryos 
C: To determine the status of DNA fragmentation in infected embryo cells 
D: To quantify the level of bacterial aggregation in infected embryos 
Answer:  C: To determine the status of DNA fragmentation in infected embryo cells.
