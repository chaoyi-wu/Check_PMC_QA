Caption: 
(A) BAL cell differential of RSV-infected mice. Mice were treated with cyclophosphamide (CYP) or vehicle 5 days before infection with RSV. Animals were sacrificed on day 4 postinfection and BAL was performed. Following cytocentrifugation, BAL cells were stained with Leukostat and counted from 4 different slides from each group in a blinded fashion. Cell counts as percentage of total were plotted. (B) Measurement of airway hyperrresponsiveness (AHR). Mice treated as above were tested for AHR by methacholine challenge in a plethysmograph. AHR is expressed as PENH, percent of control. (C) Lung histopathology. Mice were infected with RSV alone (C and D) or treated with cyclophosphamide (A and B) prior to RSV infection. The third group of mice was not exposed to RSV (E and F). Animals were sacrificed on day 5 and their lungs removed and sectioned. Paraffin-embedded lung sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin.
Question: Which group of mice serves as the control in this experiment? 
 
A: RSV-infected mice. 
B: Mice treated with cyclophosphamide before RSV infection. 
C: Mice not exposed to RSV. 
D: Mice tested for AHR by methacholine challenge. 
Answer:  C: Mice not exposed to RSV.
