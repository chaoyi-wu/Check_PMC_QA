Caption: 
Decreased Fiber CoherenceDecreased fiber coherences, as observed with DTI, in persistent developmental stutterers compared with a fluent control group. A red dot indicates the peak difference in a coronal (top left), axial (top right), and a sagittal (bottom) slice.
Question:  What does DTI measure? 
 
A: blood flow 
B: muscle contraction 
C: fiber coherence 
D: brain activation 
Answer:  C: fiber coherence
