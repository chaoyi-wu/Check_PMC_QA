Caption: 
Transient expression of GFP and GFP fusion proteins in BY-2 tobacco cells. (A) GFP protein [35SΩ-sGFP (S65T)]; (B) Arabidopsis chloroplast targeting signal (pt)-GFP fusion protein [35SΩ-pt-sGFP (S65T)]; (C) putative localization signal of GGPP synthase-GFP fusion protein [35SΩ-GGPP synthase-sGFP (S65T)]
Question: What type of fusion protein is pt-sGFP? 
 
A: A protein derived from tobacco cells. 
B: A chloroplast-GGPP synthase fusion protein. 
C: A Arabidopsis-GFP fusion protein. 
D: A chloroplast targeting signal-GFP fusion protein 
Answer:  D: A chloroplast targeting signal-GFP fusion protein.
