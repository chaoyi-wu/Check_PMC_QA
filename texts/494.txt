Plot of Fisher score values for PD1 of the KPCA algorithm with varying bandwidth. The score indicates a varying magnitude of separation between the class of suspicious tissue signals and the class of normal tissue signals. Below, the fusion image I1 for S1 based KPCA with four different bandwidth values A, B, C and D is shown. Variation of the bandwidth leads to fusion images with varying imaging properties. The bandwidth B leads to a fusion image that displays the tumour with the highest contrast to the surrounding tissue and the Fisher score shows a peak at the corresponding position. For bandwidth values A, C and D, the Fisher score and the contrast in the fusion images decreases.
Question:  What happens to the Fisher score and contrast in the fusion images for bandwidths A, C, and D?
 
A: Both the Fisher score and contrast increase 
B: Both the Fisher score and contrast decrease 
C: The Fisher score decreases, but the contrast increases 
D: The Fisher score increases, but the contrast decreases 
Answer:  B: Both the Fisher score and contrast decrease
