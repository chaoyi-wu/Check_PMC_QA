Caption: 
Transposition of the type 1 IP3R with the Double Barrel Transposon (<DBT>). Transient expression in HEK-293 cells allows identification of in-frame insertions producing truncated GFP- (A) or DsRed- (B) IP3R fusion proteins. Digestion and subsequent re-ligation produces a full-length fluorescent IP3R fusion protein (C) (Scale bar = 20 Î¼m).
Question:  What is being transposed with the Double Barrel Transposon (<DBT>)? 
 
A: Phosphate group 
B: RNA polymerase 
C: IP3R 
D: DNA helicase 
Answer:  C: IP3R
