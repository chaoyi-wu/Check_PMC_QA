Caption: 
Aspergillus antigen-induced lung inflammation appears similar in wild-type, Mcp-1-/- and Ccr2-/- mice. H&E stained lung sections from PBS- or Aspergillus antigen-treated wild-type, Mcp-1-/- and Ccr2-/- mice. Representative normal airway from wild-type control mice (A) (similar findings from Mcp-1-/- and Ccr2-/- control mice are not shown). Representative lung sections from Aspergillus antigen-treated wild-type (B), Mcp-1-/- (C) and Ccr2-/- mice (D) demonstrate intense peribronchiolar and perivascular inflammation. Aspergillus antigen exposure and sample collection are described in methods. Magnification: 20Ã— objective.

A: It is not mentioned in the content 
B: It is done through nasal swab 
C: It is done through oral injection 
D: It is done through inhalation
