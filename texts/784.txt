Caption: 
Scanning electron micrograph survey of pumice granules and biofilm development. Before colonisation (A) pumice granules are blank. After 6 month of operation (B), rod shaped cells cover the pumice surface. In the 12 month biofilm, an abundant exopolymeric matrix is visible on pumice granules both at the bottom (C) and top (D) of the column.
Question:  What is the overall content of the scanning electron micrograph? 
 
A: Biofilm only 
B: Rod shaped cells development only 
C: Both biofilm and rod shaped cells development 
D: Pumice granules only 
Answer:  C: Both biofilm and rod shaped cells development
