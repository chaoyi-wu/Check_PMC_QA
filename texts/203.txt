Caption: 
Transposition of the type 1 IP3R with the Double Barrel Transposon (<DBT>). Transient expression in HEK-293 cells allows identification of in-frame insertions producing truncated GFP- (A) or DsRed- (B) IP3R fusion proteins. Digestion and subsequent re-ligation produces a full-length fluorescent IP3R fusion protein (C) (Scale bar = 20 Î¼m).
Question:  What type of fusion proteins are produced in the transposition of the type 1 IP3R with the Double Barrel Transposon? 
 
A: Truncated DsRed- IP3R fusion proteins. 
B: Full-length GFP- IP3R fusion proteins. 
C: Truncated GFP- and DsRed-IP3R fusion proteins 
D: Full-length DsRed- IP3R fusion proteins. 
Answer:  C: Truncated GFP- and DsRed-IP3R fusion proteins.
