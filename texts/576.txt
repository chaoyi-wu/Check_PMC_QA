Caption: 
Intravascular ultrasound examples of the proximal reference site and balloon injury site 30 days after the angioplasty. Note that there was both greater intimal thickening (arrows) in the vessel treated with intravenous antisense alone, and a reduction in lumen size when compared to the proximal reference segment. The balloon injury site of the vessel treated with intravenous antisense plus PESDA and 20 kHz transcutaneous ultrasound did not exhibit any reduction in lumen area or visually evident plaque.

Question: What was the effect of intravenous antisense plus PESDA and 20 kHz transcutaneous ultrasound on the balloon injury site of the vessel? 
 
A: No reduction in lumen area or visible plaque. 
B: Significant reduction in lumen area and visible plaque. 
C: Marginal reduction in lumen area and visible plaque. 
D: No effect on lumen area but significant reduction in visible plaque. 
Answer:  A: No reduction in lumen area or visible plaque.
