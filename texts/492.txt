Caption: 
Plot of Fisher score values for PD1 of the KPCA algorithm with varying bandwidth. The score indicates a varying magnitude of separation between the class of suspicious tissue signals and the class of normal tissue signals. Below, the fusion image I1 for S1 based KPCA with four different bandwidth values A, B, C and D is shown. Variation of the bandwidth leads to fusion images with varying imaging properties. The bandwidth B leads to a fusion image that displays the tumour with the highest contrast to the surrounding tissue and the Fisher score shows a peak at the corresponding position. For bandwidth values A, C and D, the Fisher score and the contrast in the fusion images decreases.
Question:  What effect does variation of the bandwidth have on the fusion images?
 
A: It changes the size of the tumour 
B: It changes the location of the tumour 
C: It changes the type of tissue present in the tumour 
D: It changes the imaging properties of the fusion images
Answer:  D: It changes the imaging properties of the fusion images
