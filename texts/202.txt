Caption: 
Transposition of the type 1 IP3R with the Double Barrel Transposon (<DBT>). Transient expression in HEK-293 cells allows identification of in-frame insertions producing truncated GFP- (A) or DsRed- (B) IP3R fusion proteins. Digestion and subsequent re-ligation produces a full-length fluorescent IP3R fusion protein (C) (Scale bar = 20 Î¼m).
Question:  What produces a full-length fluorescent IP3R fusion protein? 
 
A: Digestion and ligation. 
B: Transposition of the type 1 IP3R. 
C: Transient expression in HEK-293 cells. 
D: Full-length sequence of interactions. 
Answer:  A: Digestion and ligation.
