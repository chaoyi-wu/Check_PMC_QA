Caption: 
Detection of Su(Fu) in prostate cancer specimens. Su(Fu) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Cat# 10933) recognized only one single band (54-Kd) in D283 cells (A). Following treatment of a specific SiRNA of Su(Fu), the endogenous Su(Fu) band was greatly reduced (B). Immunohistostaining with Su(Fu) antibodies in prostate cancer specimens revealed positive (C, in red, 200×), negative (D, 200×) or weak staining (E, red, 200×).
Question:  What happens to the endogenous Su(Fu) band after treatment with specific SiRNA? 
 
A: It increases. 
B: It remains the same. 
C: It decreases. 
D: It disappears. 
Answer:  C: It decreases.
