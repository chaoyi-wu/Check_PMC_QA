Caption: 
Comparison of CF and AgNO3 staining in potato tissues. Plants were labelled with aqueous CFDA and left to translocate for 5 h prior to harvesting. Tubers or stems were hand sectioned and sections were either incubated in mineral oil and examined under a confocal microscope for CF fluorescence or stained for AsA using ethanolic AgNO3. Confocal images are shown on the left and silver stained sections on the right of each panel. A, stem (bar = 2 mm); B, developing tuber (bar = 3 mm); C, large developing tuber (bar = 5 mm).
Question:  How long were the plants left to translocate before harvesting? 
 
A: 5 minutes 
B: 5 hours 
C: 5 days 
D: 5 weeks 
Answer:  B: 5 hours
