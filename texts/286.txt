Caption: 
Direct immunofluorescence (IgG, combined with transmitted light) in saline transported skin specimen of lupus erythematosus. After 48 hours in saline there is subepidermal split formation, not present in fresh-frozen (N2) and fixed (Mi48) skin. Note the still obvious granular IgG fluorescence at the dermal side of the split. (obj. Ã—40)
Question:  What is the result of the saline transportation on skin specimen? 
 
A: Subepidermal split formation 
B: Formation of granular IgG fluorescence at the dermal side 
C: Preservation of skin cell structure 
D: No effect on the skin specimen. 
Answer:  A: Subepidermal split formation.
