Caption: 
Growth on Lophenol Induces the Accumulation of DAF-16 in the Nuclei of Neurons in a DAF-12â€“Dependent Manner(A) When grown on cholesterol, the transgenic line DAF-16a::GFP/bKO displays a diffuse staining in the cytoplasm and nuclei of many cells (only the pharynx region of an L3 larva is shown).(B) Staining of a larva of similar age by Hoechst. Note many nuclei in the pharynx.(C) The DAF-16a::GFP/bKO line grown on lophenol shows strong staining of nuclei in neurons of the pharynx, tail, and ventral cord of a dauer larva.(D) An L3 larva of DAF-16a::GFP/bKO in a daf-12 null background grown on lophenol. Note the diffuse fluorescence in the pharynx cell similar to that shown in (A).
Question:  What is the relationship between DAF-16 localization and DAF-12? 
 
A:DAF-16 does not depend on DAF-12 to accumulate in nuclei 
B:DAF-16 accumulation in nuclei depends on DAF-12 
C:DAF-12 only accumulates in the cytoplasm 
D:DAF-12 is not present in neurons. 
Answer:  B: DAF-16 accumulation in nuclei depends on DAF-12.
