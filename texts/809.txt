Caption: 
NaK2Cl cotransporter expression in human CP: Lateral ventricle plexuses were incubated with T4 (not thyroxine) antibody, which stains the secretory isoform 1 of the NaK2Cl (NKCC1) cotransporter protein. The T4 antibody (mouse monoclonal; 1:100) was from the University of Iowa Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA); the biotinylated secondary was a rat-absorbed horse antibody. Diaminobenzidine was used to develop the brown reaction product. Controls (negative staining results; not shown) involved omission of secondary and/or primary antibody. AD tissues were from patients at Braak stage V/VI (top right) and III/IV (bottom right). Images are representative of 6 CPs analyzed for AD (mean age of 76 yr) and 6 for age-matched controls (mean age of 76 yr). On average, the staining intensity of AD specimens was 50% greater than controls. The text describes staining localization. All photographs are at the same magnification.
Question:  What was the staining intensity of AD specimens compared to the age-matched controls on average? 
 
A: 25% greater. 
B: 50% greater. 
C: 75% greater. 
D: 100% greater. 
Answer:  B: 50% greater.
