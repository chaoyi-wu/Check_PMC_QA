Caption: 
 fat-7 Is Necessary for Normal Life Span and Inhibits Î²-Oxidation(A) Nomarski images of WT worms subjected to fat-7 RNAi at days 1 and 3 of adulthood. The arrow in the day 1 image points to vacuole formation in the intestine, and the arrow in the day 3 image points to clearing that results from collapse of the gonad. These characteristics are nearly identical to those observed for nhr-49(nr2041) worms (see Figure 1B).(B) QRT-PCR measurement of acs-2 and ech-1 expression in WT and nhr-49(nr2041) L4 animals grown on control RNAi bacteria (dark gray bars) or on fat-7 RNAi bacteria (blue bars). Error bars represent standard error of measurement.(C) RNAi knockdown of fat-7 expression in WT animals reduced Nile Red fat staining(D) RNAi of fat-7 in nhr-49(nr2041) also decreased fat staining.
Question:  What is the similarity between the effects of fat-7 RNAi in WT worms and nhr-49(nr2041)? 
 
A:They exhibit similar vacuole formation in the intestine. 
B:They exhibit similar clearing resulting from the collapse of the gonad. 
C:They exhibit identical characteristics. 
D:Cannot be determined from the given information. 
Answer:  C:They exhibit identical characteristics.
