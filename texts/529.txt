Caption: 
Immunostaining of NFκB protein in stroma (S), glandular epithelium (GE), squamous epithelium (SQ) and vessels (V) in cervical biopsies from the NP (left column, a, d, g, j), TP (middle column, b, e, h) and PP (right column, c, f, i, l) groups. Positive nuclear and cytoplasmic immunostaining is also observed in neuronal ganglions (G) (h). Some leukocytes, identified by their morphology, display positive NFκB staining (l, black arrowhead). A negative control where the primary antibody is replaced by rabbit IgG is shown in k.
Question:  What is shown in the negative control? 
 
A:Primary antibody is replaced by rabbit IgG 
B:Primary antibody is replaced by mouse IgG 
C:Primary antibody is replaced by goat IgG 
D:Primary antibody is replaced by cow IgG 
Answer:  A:Primary antibody is replaced by rabbit IgG
