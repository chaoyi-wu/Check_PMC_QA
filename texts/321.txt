Caption: 
GFP expression in ET2 line embryos is indistinguishable from endogenous PARG gene expression. 23 hpf embryos collected from a heterozygous outcross were photographed for GFP fluorescence and sibling embryos were fixed for in situ hybridization. (A) In situ hybridization with PARG antisense probe. (B) In situ with GFP antisense probe. (C) Visualization of GFP expression in living embryos using a bandpass GFP filter set. (D) The same embryo as in (C) photographed using a bandpass GFP filter set with a low level of bright field illumination to visualize GFP expression in relative position to the somites.
Question:  What is the purpose of the experiment? 
 
A: To test the expression of PARG gene in ET2 line embryos 
B: To test the expression of GFP gene in ET2 line embryos 
C: To compare the expression of GFP gene with the expression of PARG gene in ET2 line embryos 
D: To outcross heterozygous embryos 
Answer:  C: To compare the expression of GFP gene with the expression of PARG gene in ET2 line embryos
