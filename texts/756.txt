Caption: 
Circular representation of the B. licheniformis ATCC 14580 chromosome. Circles are numbered from 1 (outermost) to 7 (innermost). Circles 1 and 2 show the locations of predicted CDSs on the + and - strands, respectively; circle 3, %G+C; circle 4, GC skew ((G-C/G+C)); circle 5, homology with B. subtilis 168; circle 6, homology with B. halodurans; circle 7 shows positions of nine copies of insertion sequence element IS3Bli1 and a putative transposase gene; small green bars inside circle 7 denote the positions of possible prophage elements.
Question:  Which circle shows the %G+C content of the chromosome? 
 
A: circle 1 
B: circle 2 
C: circle 3 
D: circle 4 
Answer:  circle 3
