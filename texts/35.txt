Caption: 
Time-Lapse Imaging of Astrocytes In VivoFour astrocytes, from which fluorometric Ca2+ imaging (0.5 Hz) was made, are outlined. A blood vessel, outlined by the astrocyte end feet, runs diagonally across the viewed area. White arrows show the end foot connected to the imaged astrocyte.

A: To measure blood flow in astrocytes. 
B: To observe astrocytes in vivo. 
C: To monitor calcium levels in blood vessels. 
D: To measure the thickness of astrocytes. 
Answer:  B: To observe astrocytes in vivo.
