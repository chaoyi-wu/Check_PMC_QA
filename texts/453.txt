Caption: 
(Left) Correlations between volume and the performance status of CFS patients in the right prefrontal cortex (BA9; Talairach's coordinates: x = 48, y = 32 and z = 41). The colored bar indicates the t-values. (Right) Gray-matter volumes of CFS patients at the voxels of maximum correlation (r = 0.71) plotted against the performance status. The linear-regression line is plotted in blue. a.u., arbitrary units; Rt PFC, right prefrontal cortex.
