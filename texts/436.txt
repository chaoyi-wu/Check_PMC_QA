Caption: 
WT Aggregates Are More Likely to Have TUNEL-Positive Cells Than ΔRD1 AggregatesRepresentative fluorescent images of aggregates following TUNEL staining of 6-d postfertilization embryos infected with 71 green-fluorescent WT (A), or 474 green-fluorescent ΔRD1 (B) bacteria. TUNEL staining is imaged with red fluorescence, and colocalization with green-fluorescent bacteria appears yellow. Scale bar, 100 μm.
Question:  In the experiment, what does the yellow fluorescence signify in the images? 
 
A: TUNEL-positive cells 
B: Green-fluorescent bacteria 
C: Areas of cell death 
D: Presence of a specific protein 
Answer:  B: Green-fluorescent bacteria.
