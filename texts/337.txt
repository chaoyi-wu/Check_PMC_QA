Caption: 
Tat-dependent expression of APOBEC3G. HeLa cells were transfected with pNL-A1 and pHIV-APO3G at a 1:1 molar ratio. Transfected cells were grown on cover slips for 24 hr and then either fixed with ice-cold methanol (panels A-C) or with formaldehyde buffer as described in Methods (panels D-F). Cells were stained with an APOBEC3G-specific antibody (A & D) and a Vif monoclonal antibody (B & E) as in figure 2 and analyzed on a confocal microscope. Panels C & F are overlays of panels A & B and D & E, respectively. Arrow heads are defined as follows: white = APOBEC3G:Vif-double-positive cells; yellow = Vif-negative cells; blue = APOBEC3G negative cells.
Question:  How long were the transfected cells grown on cover slips before fixation? 
 
A: 12 hr 
B: 24 hr 
C: 36 hr 
D: 48 hr  
Answer:  B: 24 hr
