Caption: 
Transposition of the type 1 IP3R with the Double Barrel Transposon (<DBT>). Transient expression in HEK-293 cells allows identification of in-frame insertions producing truncated GFP- (A) or DsRed- (B) IP3R fusion proteins. Digestion and subsequent re-ligation produces a full-length fluorescent IP3R fusion protein (C) (Scale bar = 20 μm).
Question:  What is the scale bar value for the image? 
 
A: 10 μm. 
B: 20 μm. 
C: 30 μm. 
D: 40 μm. 
Answer:  B: 20 μm.
