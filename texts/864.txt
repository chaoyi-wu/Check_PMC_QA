Summary of Phenotypes DeterminedLight (left panels) and scanning electron (right panels) micrographs of mosaic Drosophila eyes. Large homozygous mutant clones are orange (arrowheads); heterozygous tissues are dark red. Examples are shown of lethal mutations that give a (A) wild-type (63.4% of lethal mutations), (B) rough (disordered ommatidia, 18.2%), (C) cell lethal (absence of homozygous mutant tissue, 14.5%), and (D) glossy (loss of lens structure, 3.9%) phenotype. For details on how clones are generated, see http://www.bruinfly.ucla.edu.

A: Disordered ommatidia
