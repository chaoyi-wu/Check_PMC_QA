Caption: 
FRAP of HP1â€“GFP Reveals a Dynamic Association with HeterochromatinA fraction of a heterochromatic cluster (arrowhead) was bleached by a laser pulse, and recovery of fluorescence was monitored by time-lapse imaging. Images were kindly provided by Thierry Cheutin and Tom Misteli.
Question: What was monitored by time-lapse imaging in the experiment? 
 
A: Movement of the cell membrane 
B: Recovery of fluorescence 
C: Bleaching of the heterochromatic cluster 
D: Damage to the heterochromatic cluster 
Answer:  B: Recovery of fluorescence
