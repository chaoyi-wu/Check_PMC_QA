Caption: 
Transient expression of GFP and GFP fusion proteins in BY-2 tobacco cells. (A) GFP protein [35SΩ-sGFP (S65T)]; (B) Arabidopsis chloroplast targeting signal (pt)-GFP fusion protein [35SΩ-pt-sGFP (S65T)]; (C) putative localization signal of GGPP synthase-GFP fusion protein [35SΩ-GGPP synthase-sGFP (S65T)]

A: BY-2 tobacco cells 
B: GGPP synthase 
C: Arabidopsis thaliana 
D: Variant of GFP. 
Answer:  C: Arabidopsis thaliana.
