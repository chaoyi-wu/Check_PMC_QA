Caption: 
Transient expression of GFP and GFP fusion proteins in BY-2 tobacco cells. (A) GFP protein [35SΩ-sGFP (S65T)]; (B) Arabidopsis chloroplast targeting signal (pt)-GFP fusion protein [35SΩ-pt-sGFP (S65T)]; (C) putative localization signal of GGPP synthase-GFP fusion protein [35SΩ-GGPP synthase-sGFP (S65T)]
Question: Which protein is not fused to GFP? 
 
A: pt-sGFP 
B:sGFP
