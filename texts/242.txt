(C) Contamination tests, using plugs from a Secteur or from s*789, on wild type (wt), result in one Secteur at each infection point. (D)Contamination tests on s1 mutant did not result in the induction of any Secteur at the infection points.

A: no Secteur was induced at the infection points 
B: only one Secteur was induced at the infection point 
C: multiple Secteurs were induced at the infection points 
D: the experiment was unsuccessful.
