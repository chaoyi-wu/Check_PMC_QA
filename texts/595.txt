Caption: 
Transient expression of GFP and GFP fusion proteins in BY-2 tobacco cells. (A) GFP protein [35SΩ-sGFP (S65T)]; (B) Arabidopsis chloroplast targeting signal (pt)-GFP fusion protein [35SΩ-pt-sGFP (S65T)]; (C) putative localization signal of GGPP synthase-GFP fusion protein [35SΩ-GGPP synthase-sGFP (S65T)]
Question: What is the purpose of the experiment? 
 
A:To grow tobacco plants 
B:To produce GFP in tobacco cells. 
C:To test the function of Arabidopsis chloroplast targeting signal 
D:To produce GGPP synthase-sGFP in Arabidopsis. 
Answer:  B: To produce GFP in tobacco cells.
