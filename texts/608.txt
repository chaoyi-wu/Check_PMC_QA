Stereo Representations of the SARS s2m RNA Structure(A) The overall SARS s2m RNA three-dimensional structure and (B) a detailed view of tertiary contacts the and [Mg(H2O)5]2+ binding sites in the context of the experimentally phased electron density map (dark blue). The [Mg(H2O)5]2+ complex ions, depicted as white octahedra, bind to the pro-R and pro-S phosphate oxygen atoms of A(12). An extensive network of potential hydrogen bonds between the metal-coordinated water molecules and the RNA is shown as yellow dotted lines.
Question:  What is the color of the experimentally phased electron density map shown in panel B of the Stereo Representation figure? 
 
A: Dark blue 
B: White 
C: Yellow 
D: Green 
Answer:  Dark blue.
