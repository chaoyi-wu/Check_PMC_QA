Caption: 
Scrib is not localized in focal adhesions in CV-1 cells, and is dispensable for targeting LPP to these structures. Upper panels: CV-1 cells, grown on glass coverslips, were double labelled with Scrib-472 antibodies (left panel) and anti-vinculin antibodies (right panel) used as a marker for focal adhesions. Lower panels: CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type human LPP (left panel), or LPP with a mutated carboxy-terminus (T610A) (right panel), as GFP-fusions. GFP-fluorescence was visualized by epifluorescence microscopy.
Question: What was the aim of the experiment? 
 
A:To study the morphology of focal adhesions. 
B:To study the role of LPP in Scrib localization. 
C:To study the role of Scrib in LPP targeting. 
D:To study the role of Scrib and LPP in cell cycle. 
Answer:  C:To study the role of Scrib in LPP targeting.
