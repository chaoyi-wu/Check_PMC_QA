Caption: 
Angiotensin II receptor 1 staining in lung biopsies from control patients (A) and from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (B). Immunohistochemistry for the angiotensin II receptor 1 (AGTR1), counterstained with haematoxylin. AGTR1 positive staining is seen in alveolar macrophages, in epithelial cells and in fibroblastic foci (arrows) in usual interstitial pneumonia biopsies (panel B). Epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages express AGTR1 in control lung biopsies (panel A).
Question:  What is AGTR1? 
 
A: An anti-inflammatory mediator 
B: A marker for lung cancer 
C: A receptor for angiotensin II 
D: A type of lung cell. 
Answer:  C: A receptor for angiotensin II.
