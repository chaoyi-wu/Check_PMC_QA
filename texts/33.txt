Caption: 
Decreased Fiber CoherenceDecreased fiber coherences, as observed with DTI, in persistent developmental stutterers compared with a fluent control group. A red dot indicates the peak difference in a coronal (top left), axial (top right), and a sagittal (bottom) slice.
Question:  In which slices were the peak differences observed? 
 
A: coronal 
B: axial 
C: sagittal 
D: all of the above 
Answer:  D: all of the above
