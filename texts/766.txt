Caption: 
Heparin, but not RAP, competes for DiI-apoE-VLDL uptake by adipocytes. Differentiated adipocytes were cultured on glass coverslips and incubated with DiI-labeled apoE-VLDL (4 μg/ml) in the presence or absence (upper panel) of either heparin (500 μg/ml, middle panel) or RAP-GST (50 μg/ml, lower panel) at 37°C for 3 h. Cells were then fixed and processed for fluorescence microscopy. Left panels, phase contrast image; right panels, rhodamine filter set (550 nm excitation-573 nm emission). Magnification, 630×.
Question:  What is the duration of incubation? 
 
A: 1h 
B: 2h 
C: 3h 
D: 4h  
Answer:  C: 3h
