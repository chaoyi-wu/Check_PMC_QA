Caption: 
Recapitulation of human xanthinuria type 1 by rosy mutants. (a) Wild-type tubule; (b) tubule from adult ry2 homozygous fly. Both micrographs are at the same magnification, and the diameter of the wild-type tubule can be taken as 35 Î¼m.
Question:  What is the purpose of the micrographs? 
 
A: To show the difference between a wild-type tubule and a tubule from a ry2 homozygous fly. 
B: To show the size of a wild-type tubule. 
C: To show that xanthinuria type 1 can be recapitulated in rosy mutants. 
D: To show the difference between a wild-type tubule and a tubule from an adult ry2 homozygous fly. 
Answer:  A: To show the difference between a wild-type tubule and a tubule from a ry2 homozygous fly.
