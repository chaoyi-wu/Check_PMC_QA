Caption: 
Growth on Lophenol Induces the Accumulation of DAF-16 in the Nuclei of Neurons in a DAF-12â€“Dependent Manner(A) When grown on cholesterol, the transgenic line DAF-16a::GFP/bKO displays a diffuse staining in the cytoplasm and nuclei of many cells (only the pharynx region of an L3 larva is shown).(B) Staining of a larva of similar age by Hoechst. Note many nuclei in the pharynx.(C) The DAF-16a::GFP/bKO line grown on lophenol shows strong staining of nuclei in neurons of the pharynx, tail, and ventral cord of a dauer larva.(D) An L3 larva of DAF-16a::GFP/bKO in a daf-12 null background grown on lophenol. Note the diffuse fluorescence in the pharynx cell similar to that shown in (A).
Question:  What is the effect of growth on cholesterol on DAF-16a::GFP/bKO? 
 
A:Diffuse staining in cytoplasm only 
B:Strong staining of nuclei in neurons 
C:No staining observed 
D:Staining of nuclei in the pharynx only. 
Answer:  A: Diffuse staining in cytoplasm only.
