Increased Muscle Damage in HIF-1α KOs Following Repeated Exercise(A) WT mice and HIF-1α KOs underwent a 4-d endurance test, in which animals were run to exhaustion on each of four successive days with a minimum of 22 h rest between trials. HIF-1α KOs demonstrated initially greater endurance under the protocol; however, by the second day, their endurance advantage was eliminated, and by the fourth day, HIF-1α KOs were running for a significantly shorter time (**p < 0.01) than on the first day, while WT animals were running for approximately similar times as on the first day. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the decrease in performance on each successive day was unique to HIF-1α KOs (p < 0.05).(B) Example of hematoxylin and eosin staining of gastrocnemius muscles after 1 d of recovery by mice after the 4-d endurance test. Evidence of greater damage can be seen in HIF-1α KO muscles compared to WT muscles.(C) Example of PCNA staining of gastrocnemius muscles from exercised mice, demonstrating increased levels of muscle regeneration in HIF-1α KOs.(D) Number of PCNA-positive nuclei per square millimeter in gastrocnemius muscles of WT mice (n = 5) and HIF-1α KOs (n = 7) that ran repeatedly for 4 d. Although HIF-1α KOs have almost twice as many PCNA-positive nuclei per square millimeter, the difference is not significant, because of wild variations in that population. F-test analysis of the data reveals that the variance is much greater in the HIF-1α KO population than the WT population (p < 0.05).
Question:  What is the effect of HIF-1α KO on endurance exercise? 
 
A: HIF-1α KO results in higher endurance than WT mice. 
B: HIF-1α KO initially shows increased endurance but decreases over time. 
C: HIF-1α KO has no effect on endurance exercise. 
D: HIF-1α KO shows a significant increase in endurance over time. 
Answer:  B: HIF-1α KO initially shows increased endurance but decreases over time.
