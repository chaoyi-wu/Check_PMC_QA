Caption: 
Neuronal marker expression in CbCln3+/+ cells Characterization of CbCln3+/+ cells by immunofluorescence with marker antibodies is shown. CbCln3+/+ precursors exhibit nestin expression (a) but not GFAP expression (b), consistent with a neuronal precursor identity. Upon stimulation with a differentiation cocktail (see Methods), CbCln3+/+ cells achieved neuron-like morphology, with rounded cell bodies and extension of processes, and MAP2 (c) and NeuN (d) expression was increased. CbCln3+/+ cells are negative for the Purkinje neuron marker calbindin (e). CbCln3+/Δex7/8 and CbCln3Δex7/8/Δex7/8 cell lines exhibited identical marker immunofluorescence results. a, b) 20 × magnification; c, d, e) 40 × magnification.
Question:  How did CbCln3+/Δex7/8 and CbCln3Δex7/8/Δex7/8 cell lines compare in marker expression results to CbCln3+/+ cells? 
 
A: They showed different marker expression results than CbCln3+/+ cells 
B: They showed the same marker expression results as CbCln3+/+ cells 
C: There is no mention of CbCln3+/Δex7/8 and CbCln3Δex7/8/Δex7/8 cell lines in the passage 
D: There is not enough information in the passage to determine the marker expression results of CbCln3+/Δex7/8 and CbCln3Δex7/8/Δex7/8 cell lines 
Answer:  B: They showed the same marker expression results as CbCln3+/+ cells
