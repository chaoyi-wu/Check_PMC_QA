Caption: 
Immunocytochemistry determination of IREG1. Hippocampal neurons and SH-SY5Y cells, labeled with rabbit anti-IREG1 antibody and with Alexa-546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, were imaged in a confocal microscope. Shown are representative fields of cells cultured at different iron concentrations. Note the preferentially cytosolic distribution of IREG1.
Question:  What is the label used for the secondary antibody in the study? 
 
A: Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG 
B: Alexa-546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG 
C: Alexa-546-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG 
D: Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG 
Answer:  B: Alexa-546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
