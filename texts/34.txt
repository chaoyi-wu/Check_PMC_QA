Caption: 
Decreased Fiber CoherenceDecreased fiber coherences, as observed with DTI, in persistent developmental stutterers compared with a fluent control group. A red dot indicates the peak difference in a coronal (top left), axial (top right), and a sagittal (bottom) slice.
Question:  What does the red dot represent in the imaging slices? 
 
A: a damaged area 
B: a peak difference 
C: a control group
