Caption: 
Immunocytochemistry of isolated mouse ventricular myocytes demonstrating the subcellular localization of Kir6.1, Kir6.2, SUR1 and SUR2 subunits. A: Double staining of a ventricular myocyte with the CAF-1 anti-Kir6.1 antibody (A1) and 76A anti-Kir6.2 antibody (A2). Panel A3 is an overlay of panels A1 and A2. Secondary antibodies used were Cy-3 conjugated donkey anti-chicken IgY (red) and Cy-2 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (green). Yellow in panel C demonstrates areas of co-localization. The image width is 91 μm. B: Ventricular myocyte probed with anti-SUR1 antibodies and detected with Cy-3 conjugated donkey anti goat secondary antibodies. Image width is 148 μm. C: Staining with a pan-SUR2 antibody (detected with Cy-2 conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG). The image width is 229 μm. D: An isolated myocyte was stained with MitoTracker Red (500 nM) before being paraformaldehyde fixed and viewed with confocal microscopy Image width is 47 μm.
Question:  What kind of antibodies were used in the study? 
 
A: Anti-Kir6.1 antibody and anti-SUR2 antibody. 
B: Anti-Kir6.2 antibody and anti-SUR1 antibody. 
C: Anti-Kir6.1 antibody and anti-Kir6.2 antibody. 
D: Pan-SUR2 antibody and anti-SUR1 antibody. 
Answer:  C: Anti-Kir6.1 antibody and anti-Kir6.2 antibody.
