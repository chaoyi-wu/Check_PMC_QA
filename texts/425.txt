Caption: 
Composite image showing an angiographic right anterior oblique projection of the left coronary system (Panel B) and two intravascular ultrasound images (Panels A&C) before the intervention. Dotted line shows the approximate location of the IVUS slices. An eccentric plaque is visible in the proximal left anterior descending artery (Panel B), with some haziness at the distal end. IVUS confirms the presence of the plaque (Panel A) and shows a bulky, partially organized, thrombus (Panel C) loosely attached to the distal end of the plaque. No signs of plaque rupture are visible.

A: Right anterior oblique artery
