Stereo Representations of the SARS s2m RNA Structure(A) The overall SARS s2m RNA three-dimensional structure and (B) a detailed view of tertiary contacts the and [Mg(H2O)5]2+ binding sites in the context of the experimentally phased electron density map (dark blue). The [Mg(H2O)5]2+ complex ions, depicted as white octahedra, bind to the pro-R and pro-S phosphate oxygen atoms of A(12). An extensive network of potential hydrogen bonds between the metal-coordinated water molecules and the RNA is shown as yellow dotted lines.
Question:  Which atom of A(12) binds to the [Mg(H2O)5]2+ complex ions? 
 
A: Phosphate oxygen atom in pro-R 
B: Phosphate oxygen atom in pro-S 
C: Phosphate nitrogen atom 
D: Ribose sugar oxygen atom 
Answer:  Phosphate oxygen atom in pro-R.
