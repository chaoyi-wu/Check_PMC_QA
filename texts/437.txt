Caption: 
WT Aggregates Are More Likely to Have TUNEL-Positive Cells Than ΔRD1 AggregatesRepresentative fluorescent images of aggregates following TUNEL staining of 6-d postfertilization embryos infected with 71 green-fluorescent WT (A), or 474 green-fluorescent ΔRD1 (B) bacteria. TUNEL staining is imaged with red fluorescence, and colocalization with green-fluorescent bacteria appears yellow. Scale bar, 100 μm.
Question:  Which type of bacterial infection resulted in more TUNEL-positive cells in the experiment? 
 
A: WT aggregates 
B: ΔRD1 aggregates 
C: Neither had TUNEL-positive cells 
D: Both had similar amounts of TUNEL-positive cells 
Answer:  A: WT aggregates.
