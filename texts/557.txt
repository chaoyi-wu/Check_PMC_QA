Delayed chlorophyll fluorescence images. Luminescence from leaves of Arabidopsis (A) and Tradescantia (B). Images are 5-minute exposures taken as soon as possible after transfer of leaves to the equipment. A conventional photograph of the Tradescantia leaf imaged in (B) is shown to illustrate the pattern of variegation (C).
Question: What is the exposure time for the images? 
 
A:2-minute exposures 
B:5-minute exposures 
C:10-minute exposures 
D:15-minute exposures 
Answer:  B:5-minute exposures
