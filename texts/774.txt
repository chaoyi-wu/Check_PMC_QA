Caption: 
Phase-contrast photomicrographs of fragile X progenitor cells The figure shows clusters/spheres during the initial stages (2–3 days after plating) of adherence to a fibronectin substrate. (A) 4×; (B) 10×; (C) 20×. Confluent serum- and growth factor-expanded cultures were serum deprived for one week in the presence of growth factors, then lifted with enzyme-free buffers and transferred to new plates with no fibronectin substrate. After growing the resulting clusters/spheres for two weeks, the clusters/spheres were transferred to new fibronectin-coated plates. Clusters/spheres (black arrows) are abundant and are seen adhering to the substrate. Cells (black arrowheads) can be seen streaming from the spheres and spreading out on the substrate.
Question: What is the timeframe for the growth of clusters/spheres in the experiment? 
 
A: 1 day 
B: 2 weeks 
C: 1 month 
D: 6 months 
Answer:  B: 2 weeks
