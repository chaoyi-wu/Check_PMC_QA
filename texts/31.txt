Decreased Fiber CoherenceDecreased fiber coherences, as observed with DTI, in persistent developmental stutterers compared with a fluent control group. A red dot indicates the peak difference in a coronal (top left), axial (top right), and a sagittal (bottom) slice.
Question:  What is the difference in fiber coherence between stutterers and fluent individuals? 
 
A: increased 
B: decreased 
C: no difference 
D: unclear 
Answer:  B: decreased
