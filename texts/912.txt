Caption: 
Histological analysis of eye development in severely affected eyeless Ptdsr -/- embryos. (a) In anophthalmic Ptdsr -/- embryos, unilateral or bilateral absence of the eyes could be detected. (b-d) Serial H&E-stained sagittal sections of homozygous mutant embryos at (b) E17.5 and (c,d) E18.5 show complex malformation of the optic cup and lack of any lens structure. Careful examination of adjacent sections (b-d) reveals an ectopic misplacement of retinal-pigmented epithelium in the maxillary sinus. Not only is the deposition of pigment clearly visible (higher magnification insets) but also the induction of proliferation of underlying tissues and the change in morphology of the maxillary sinus (d). Scale bar, 100 Î¼m in (b-d).
Question:  What was revealed by careful examination of adjacent sections of homozygous mutant embryos? 
 
A: Ectopic misplacement of retinal-pigmented epithelium in the brain tissue 
B: Ectopic misplacement of the optic nerve in the maxillary sinus 
C: Ectopic misplacement of the cornea on the surface of the nose 
D: Ectopic misplacement of retinal-pigmented epithelium in the maxillary sinus, leading to pigmentation, proliferation induction of underlying tissue and morphological changes. 
Answer:  D: Ectopic misplacement of retinal-pigmented epithelium in the maxillary sinus, leading to pigmentation, proliferation induction of underlying tissue and morphological changes.
