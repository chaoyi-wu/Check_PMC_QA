Caption: 
Decreased Fiber CoherenceDecreased fiber coherences, as observed with DTI, in persistent developmental stutterers compared with a fluent control group. A red dot indicates the peak difference in a coronal (top left), axial (top right), and a sagittal (bottom) slice.
Question:  Which brain imaging technique was used to detect differences in fiber coherence? 
 
A: MRI 
B: CT scan 
C: EEG 
D: PET scan 
Answer:  A: MRI
