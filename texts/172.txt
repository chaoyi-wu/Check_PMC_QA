Caption: 
Cytotoxicity and OAS1 induction with RNAi vectors. In A, morphology was observed using phase contrast microscopy of non-transduced IS-1 cells, or cells six days after transduction with vectors leading to expression of no shRNA (U6PT), a 25 mer shRNA targeting PAI-2 (sh325) and a scrambled 25 mer control shRNA (sh325scr). B shows comparison of OAS1 expression in non-transduced cells or cells four days after transduction with U6PT, sh325 and sh325scr vectors, by QRT-PCR. Each target gene was detected in duplicate, error bars represent the standard deviation of mean values.
Question: How long after transduction were cells analyzed for OAS1 expression in panel B? 
 
A:Four days 
B:Six days 
C:Two days 
D:Three days  
Answer:  Four days
