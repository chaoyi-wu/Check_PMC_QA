Caption: 
Detection of Su(Fu) in prostate cancer specimens. Su(Fu) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Cat# 10933) recognized only one single band (54-Kd) in D283 cells (A). Following treatment of a specific SiRNA of Su(Fu), the endogenous Su(Fu) band was greatly reduced (B). Immunohistostaining with Su(Fu) antibodies in prostate cancer specimens revealed positive (C, in red, 200×), negative (D, 200×) or weak staining (E, red, 200×).
Question:  What color is the positive staining in the prostate cancer specimens? 
 
A: Green. 
B: Blue. 
C: Red. 
D: Yellow. 
Answer:  C: Red.
