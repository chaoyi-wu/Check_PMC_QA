Caption: 
Scrib is not localized in focal adhesions in CV-1 cells, and is dispensable for targeting LPP to these structures. Upper panels: CV-1 cells, grown on glass coverslips, were double labelled with Scrib-472 antibodies (left panel) and anti-vinculin antibodies (right panel) used as a marker for focal adhesions. Lower panels: CV-1 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type human LPP (left panel), or LPP with a mutated carboxy-terminus (T610A) (right panel), as GFP-fusions. GFP-fluorescence was visualized by epifluorescence microscopy.

A:It is localized in focal adhesions. 
B:It is dispensable. 
C:It helps in targeting LPP. 
D:Its role is not specified. 
Answer:  B:It is dispensable.
