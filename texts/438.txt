Caption: 
WT Aggregates Are More Likely to Have TUNEL-Positive Cells Than ΔRD1 AggregatesRepresentative fluorescent images of aggregates following TUNEL staining of 6-d postfertilization embryos infected with 71 green-fluorescent WT (A), or 474 green-fluorescent ΔRD1 (B) bacteria. TUNEL staining is imaged with red fluorescence, and colocalization with green-fluorescent bacteria appears yellow. Scale bar, 100 μm.
Question:  What is the developmental stage of the embryos used in the experiment? 
 
A: 2-d postfertilization embryos 
B: 4-d postfertilization embryos 
C: 6-d postfertilization embryos 
D: 8-d postfertilization embryos 
Answer:  C: 6-d postfertilization embryos.
